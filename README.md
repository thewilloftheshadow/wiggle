# Wiggle

This bot is a bot that will respond with a wiggle chain when you say the word `wiggle`!    

There are no commands for this bot except `;;ping` to see if the bot is online. All it does is respond if your message contains the word `wiggle`    

It is recommended that you only give the bot "Read Messages" permisisons in your #spam-chat or similar chat, and as such, the default permissions in the invite link do not include the "Read Messages" permission, you should add that yourself for your spam chat only.    
In lieu of a ratelimit right now, we only use Discord's default ratelimiting and a manual blacklist if you spam too much, so play nice and keep the bot simple <3
